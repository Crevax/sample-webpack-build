# Sample Webpack Environment
By: Robby Emmert

### Dependencies  
1. **Node JS**:  
I recommend installing Node JS with NVM: [For Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), [For Mac](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)  
2. **Mac, Windows, or Linux**  

### Quick Start
1. Fork this repository.  Rename it to whatever you want your project to be called.
2. Clone *your* fork of the repository (the fork you just made).
3. `cd` into the just-cloned project folder.
4. Type `npm install` to install all of the NodeJS dependencies for the project (see a list below).
5. Type `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server` to install Webpack for yourself.
6. Type `npm start` to start the Webpack Dev Server.  Your project is running (with live-reloading code) at localhost:8080
