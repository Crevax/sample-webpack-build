### Quick Start
1. Fork this repository.  Rename it to whatever you want your project to be called.
2. Clone *your* fork of the repository (the fork you just made).
3. `cd` into the just-cloned project folder.
4. Type `npm install` to install all of the NodeJS dependencies for the project (see a list below).
5. Type `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server` to install Webpack for yourself.
6. Type `npm start` to start the Webpack Dev Server.  Your project is running (with live-reloading code) at localhost:8080
