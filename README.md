# Sample Webpack Environment
By: Robby Emmert

### Dependencies  
1. **Node JS**:  
If you don't have Node JS, you'll need it for this tutorial.  I suggest installing it with NVM (as it can save lots of headaches when switching Node versions).  [Here's](docs/NVMIntro.md) a quick tutorial on NVM.
2. **Mac, Windows, or Linux**  

### Quick Start
1. Fork this repository.  Rename it to whatever you want your project to be called.
2. Clone *your* fork of the repository (the fork you just made).
3. `cd` into the just-cloned project folder.
4. Type `npm install` to install all of the NodeJS dependencies for the project (see a list below).
5. Type `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server` to install Webpack for yourself.
6. Type `npm start` to start the Webpack Dev Server.  Your project is running (with live-reloading code) at http://localhost:8080.  As soon as you save a file, it should re-load in real time in your browser.
